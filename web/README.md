# dist/

This directory contains the **compiled production build** of the React application from:

**https://github.com/Rafalsky/rafalsky-motors**

It has been included **solely as a proof of concept** frontend application for use in this Snowplow tracking lab project.  
The contents of this folder are generated by the React build pipeline (`npm run build` / `yarn build`) and **should not be edited manually**.

If you need to modify the frontend:

1. Clone or update the source repository:
   https://github.com/Rafalsky/rafalsky-motors
2. Make changes in the React source code.
3. Rebuild the project.
4. Replace the contents of this `dist/` folder with the newly built output.

This folder exists only to provide a lightweight, static, production-ready frontend that can be served by Nginx inside this Snowplow tracking proof-of-concept environment.
